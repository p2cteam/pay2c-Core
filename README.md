Pay2c is a PoS-based cryptocurrency.
===========================

We are a coin based on the Proof-Of-Stake
(POS) SCRYPT algorithm, as a maximum supply of 10 million
coins,we have brought a relatively simple project that
covers a simple and easy to understand marketing area,
Pay to Click ( PTC).

We are not guaranteeing a new concept in digital currencies,
a new algorithm or unique ecosystem, we are just trying to
implement Altcoins in this market, exactly what is not happening now,
few pay-to-click sites use Bitcoin around 10% or any less.

We just need to have a working currency and a platform that
works simply, covering all the requirements to attract investors,
advertisers and a public.

Bringing a new concept of pay-to-click sites where users
can get straight into their wallets every 24 hours where they do
their actions within a platform would be a start to create
exactly what we want.
